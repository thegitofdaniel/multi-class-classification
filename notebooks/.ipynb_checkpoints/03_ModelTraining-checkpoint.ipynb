    "- www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/personas/data/MovieSummaries.tar.gz\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary:\n",
    "- In this exercise, we use Tensorflow to model neural networks and perform multi-label classification.\n",
    "- The dataset contains text data on many different movies. Our task is to create a model that correctly predicts the genre of each movie based on its summary. As each movie may have one genre ore more, this is multi-label classification (i.e. each genre is a label, and a movie may have more than one genre).\n",
    "\n",
    "- One technicality:\n",
    "    - Multi-class is choosing one exclusive category out of many;\n",
    "    - Multi-label is choosing at least one category out of many.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Notebooks:\n",
    "- In *notebook 01* we will have a look at the *metadata* to understand a bit more about the labels.\n",
    "- In *notebook 02* we will clean the text data of movie plots, and create a dataset that we can use in model training.\n",
    "- In *notebook 03* we will train a baseline model using a logistic regression.\n",
    "- In *notebook 04* we will finally train the neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Set-up\n",
    "## Environment\n",
    "- First, create the *tf_env* environment following the instructions in the README.\n",
    "- Alternatively, you can use an environment of your own that has tensorflow installed.\n",

      "Plot:  Marcos, a young reporter, goes to a circus to write a Sunday supplement piece. As he is leaving, the next act is about to start. It involves a woman riding a horse and performing tricks; the presentation ends in shooting balloons from a horse while it is moving. Marcos is taken by the beauty of Ana, the equestrian sharpshooter, and returns to interview her. She invites him to dinner with the troupe. They dance, and then spend the night together. He falls in love with the beautiful horse-riding circus girl. An affair between them ensues; he considers following her around Europe and promises he would follow her to hell. Soon, Marco has to leave to cover a concert in Barcelona. Fate intervenes when three young mechanics come to repair circus equipment and the owner gives them complimentary tickets for the show. The trio makes a racket as they watch Ana perform. After the show, they follow Ana to her trailer and brutally rape her. Although she is badly hurt, she decides to take matters into her own hands. Bruised, humiliated, and bleeding, she picks up her rifle and goes to hunt them down. She finds them easily at the mechanic shop where they work. She kills them all and leaves without being clearly identified. Ana, who is bleeding badly, has to visit a doctor who reveals to the authorities that she has been raped. The police initially have no clues about the culprit of the triple homicide, but after interviewing the doctor, they begin to suspect Ana. Ana is stopped in a highway by two officers; she panics and kills them too, a decision that she regrets immediately. Marco who goes to Ana’s trailer, finds traces of blood all over the place and he and the authorities go in search of Ana. She finds refuge in a country home where a couple and two small children live. Marcos is responsible for breaking the impasse between Ana and the police, but he arrives too late to help her; the police open fire on her, and she dies in his arms. \n",

The new duty pleases his girlfriend, May, who is glad that her boyfriend is no longer taking difficult cases and has more time to see her. However, the happy mood changes when Ka-Kui is greeted by Chu Tao and his bespectacled right-hand man John Ko. It seems Chu Tao is terminally ill with only three months left to live, so he has been released from prison, and while he is still alive he vows to make life difficult for Ka-Kui. John Ko and some henchmen show up at Ka-Kui's apartment and intimidate him, baiting the policeman to attack. Later, May and her mother are beaten by John Ko and his men. Ka-Kui can no longer hold back, and he lashes out against John Ko and his men at a restaurant. Ashamed of his behavior, Ka-Kui resigns from the Royal Hong Kong Police Force. He plans to take a trip to Bali with May, but while he is at a travel agency in a shopping mall, some police officers see him and report that the mall is under a bomb threat. Unable to resist the urge to get involved in police work, Ka-Kui tells the officers to sound the fire alarm and have the mall cleared, and agrees to take responsibility for the decision. A bomb does indeed explode, and the entire mall is leveled by the blast. Ka-Kui is praised for his efforts, and he is reinstated and assigned to solve the case of the bombing. Ka-Kui plants a covert listening device in the mall property company's office to try and learn more about the bombers. This leads to a suspect who is a deaf-mute and is a fierce martial artist and explosives expert. The bombing gang, aware that the police are on to them, plan a simultaneous bombing of the property company and the police headquarters. They double their ransom demand to $20 million and kidnap May, luring Ka-Kui into a trap in which he is strapped with an explosive vest and forced to pick up the extortion money from the property company. However, after picking up the money, Ka-Kui tells the gang that they are being followed and split up. Ka-kui, still holding the ransom, is able to drive his car into a tunnel so that the bomb he is wearing cannot be activated and he strips it off. He then goes to rescue May, who is being held in a warehouse full of fireworks. Ka-Kui again faces the deaf-mute man, who throws small firebombs at him. Ka-Kui then gains the upper hand and brutally retaliates against the mute man, finally throwing him off a third story catwalk onto a pile of plastic drums below. Ka-Kui then rescues May and departs the warehouse, just as it explodes in a huge ball of fire. \n",
